[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/uk.co.tnix.exponoticlient/expo-noti-client.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22uk.co.tnix.exponoticlient%22%20AND%20a:%22expo-noti-client%22)

Basic HTTP/2 client to interact with the expo notification service. Works both asynchronously and synchronously using the Java `HTTPClient` class. Allows sending custom mobile notifications through **Expo's Push API** using a device id gathered from your own mobile device, which works both for IOS and Android devices.

## Current Build 1.0.0 - Notes
Implementation to interact with Expoâ€™s ticket service is not implemented yet. This part of the API can tell you if the notification has been sent, usually used when there is a high load and notifications are taking time to reach the user. This is currently being worked on.

## Installation

## Example Usage
Function to return a `ExpoNTicket` object which contains the success or failure of sending the notification to an example user, defined in the `String testToken` parameter.
```java
package examples;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import client.ExpoNClient;
import client.types.ExpoNMessage;
import client.types.ExpoNTicket;

public class ExampleNotiTest {
    public ExpoNTicket PushExampleAsync(String testToken) {

        //Creating new client object to send the information to Expo's push API
        ExpoNClient client = new ExpoNClient();

        //Check if this is a valid token, this token is found from your device expo notification token, see the expo docs
        if (ExpoNClient.isExpoPushToken(testToken)) {
            List<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>();
            tokens.add(testToken);

            //Create a message objects which will send the notifcation information to the API
            ExpoNMessage message = ExpoNMessage.builder()
                .setTo(tokens)
                .setBody("Hello")
                .setTitle("Title")
                .setSubtitle("Subtitle")
            .build();

            try {
            
                //Send the message data, this is using async but joined straight away
                ExpoNTicket resp = client.sendExpoPushAsync(message).join();
                return resp;   
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```
